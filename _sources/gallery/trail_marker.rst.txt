Line Chart with Varying Size
----------------------------
This is example of using the ``trail`` marker to vary the size of a line.

    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    source = data.wheat()

    alt.Chart(source).mark_trail().encode(
        x='year:T',
        y='wheat:Q',
        size='wheat:Q'
    )
    # No channel encoding options are specified in this chart
    # so the code is the same as for the method-based syntax.
