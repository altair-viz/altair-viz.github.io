--------------------------------
This example shows how to combine two plots and keep their axes.

For a more polished version of this chart, see :ref:`gallery_wheat_wages`.

    :code-below:

    
    import altair as alt
    from vega_datasets import data

    source = data.wheat()

    base = alt.Chart(source).encode(x='year:O')

    bar = base.mark_bar().encode(y='wheat:Q')

    line =  base.mark_line(color='red').encode(
        y='wages:Q'
    )

    (bar + line).properties(width=600)
