Slider Cutoff
=============
This example shows how to bind a variable parameter to a slider, and how to use the corresponding bound value to color data points.  This example is based on an example from the Altair 4 documentation for Interactions, in which the  interactivity was accomplished using a selection.  The version below has been simplified significantly through the use of a variable parameter.  Variable parameters were added in Altair 5.

    :code-below:
    

    
    import altair as alt
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    rand = np.random.RandomState(42)

    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'xval': range(100),
        'yval': rand.randn(100).cumsum()
    })

    slider = alt.binding_range(min=0, max=100, step=1)
    cutoff = alt.param(bind=slider, value=50)

    alt.Chart(df).mark_point().encode(
        x='xval',
        y='yval',
        color=alt.condition(
            alt.datum.xval < cutoff,
            alt.value('red'), alt.value('blue')
        )
    ).add_params(
        cutoff
    )
