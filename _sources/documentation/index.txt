Altair Documentation
====================


Altair's core functionality is to produce Vega-Lite JSON specifications, which
specify :ref:`mappings <encoding-reference>` between :ref:`data <defining-data>`
and :ref:`graphical markings <mark-reference>`. These encodings can include
:ref:`binnings and aggregations <encoding-aggregates>`, as well as
:ref:`data transformations and filtering <data-transformations>`.
Beyond this, plots can be customized through a number of
:ref:`configuration Settings <configuring-altair>`. Details of all of these
are discussed in the following
